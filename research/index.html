    <h1>Research Experiences</h1>

    <p>
      I am interested in social determinants of health disparities and aging, with an emphasis on chronic stressors,
      social networks, and health behaviors. I work with the Health and Retirement Study to explore how caregiving,
      education, and social support shape the cognitive outcomes and biological aging of older adults. By applying
      longitudinal designs, causal inference techniques, and biomarkers like DNA methylation clocks, I investigate how
      caregiving and family dynamics affect cognitive and biological aging across diverse groups. My work aims to uncover
      the biosocial mechanisms driving health disparities and inform strategies to promote equity and healthier aging
      throughout the life course.

          This study examined the relationship between grandparenting care and physical activity among older adults.
          I created a novel continuum to measure the intensity of grandparenting caregiving, taking into account both household
          living arrangements and caregiving hours. Through weighted logistic modeling and moderation analysis, results showed that
          individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and racial minorities were more likely to take on custodial
          grandparent roles and reported lower physical activity.

        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          I examined how the education levels of older adults’ parents and their adult children influence cognitive outcomes
          in later life. Using generalized linear modeling, inverse-probability-of-attrition weighting, and mediation analysis
          to address sample attrition and explore behavioral pathways, I found that higher education among adult children is
          linked to better cognitive function in older adults, independent of the education levels of the older adults
          themselves and their parents. The positive effect of education on cognition may be partly explained by more moderate
          drinking behaviors. This work received the William Cockerham Paper Award for best graduate student paper in 2023.

          Selection bias is a concern in caregiving research, since healthier older adults may be more likely to take on
          caregiving roles. To address this, I designed a study using propensity-score methods to strengthen causal inference.
          Using propensity-score weighting with a machine-learning model to isolate the effects of starting or stopping
          caregiving on DNA methylation age, I created caregiver variables that account for transitions into and out of
          caregiving and the intensity of care provided. Results showed that men experienced faster biological aging when they
          began high-intensity caregiving, while women showed a significant slowing of aging when they continued in
          moderate-intensity caregiving roles.

          This paper applied a causal-inference approach to address selection bias, using propensity-score matching together
          with mediation analysis to investigate how social networks influence the link between caregiving and cognitive function
          among older adults. The results indicated that older caregivers tend to have a greater number of close social ties,
          which were associated with improved cognitive outcomes. In contrast, neither perceived social support nor the broader
          composition of one’s social network demonstrated the same effect.

        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          Using HRS psychosocial and clinic measurement data, I plan to derive a psychosocial biological age from validated scales.
          I will train an elastic-net model to predict mortality or functional decline, convert predicted risk to an age equivalent,
          and compute psychosocial aging acceleration. I will then test whether caregiving exposure is associated with accelerated
          psychosocial aging.

        <p style="margin-top:8px;">
          I am writing a scoping review to understand how caregiving may affect biological aging, focusing on three broad and
          clinically meaningful measures rather than a single biomarker like telomere length. First, DNA methylation clocks
          (e.g., PhenoAge, GrimAge) estimate biological age from DNA patterns and often predict health outcomes better than earlier
          biomarkers. Second, intrinsic capacity captures the combined physical and mental abilities a person can draw on at a given
          time—mobility, cognition, sensory function, vitality, and mood. Third, frailty reflects vulnerability as physiological
          reserves diminish and is a practical indicator of risk in older adults. These measures are chosen because they are
          consistently linked with health outcomes and lend themselves more readily to clinical action in geriatric care.
