<p class="p4"><span class="s1">I am interested in social determinants of health disparities and aging, with an emphasis on chronic stressors, social networks, and health behaviors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I work with Health Retirement Study to explore how caregiving, education, and social support shape the cognitive outcomes and biological aging of older adults. By applying longitudinal design, causal inference techniques, and biomarkers like DNA methylation clocks, I investigate how caregiving and family dynamics affect cognitive and biological aging across diverse groups. My work aims to uncover the biosocial mechanisms driving health disparities and inform strategies to promote equity and healthier aging throughout the life course.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">In this paper, I examined how the education levels of older adults’ parents and their adult children influence cognitive outcomes in later life. I used generalized linear modeling, inverse-probability-of-attrition weighting, and mediation analysis to address sample attrition and explore potential behavioral pathways. The findings showed that higher education among adult children is linked to better cognitive function in older adults, independent of the education levels of the older adults themselves and their parents. Additionally, the positive effect of education on cognitive function may be partly explained by more moderate drinking behaviors.</span><span class="s2"> </span><span class="s1">This work received the William Cockerham Paper Award for best graduate student paper in 2023.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

The results indicated that older caregivers tend to have a greater number of close social ties, which were significantly associated with improved cognitive outcomes. In contrast, neither perceived social support nor the broader composition of one’s social network demonstrated the same effect.</span></h3>

<p class="p3"><span class="s1">With HRS psychosocial and clinic measurements data, I plan to derive a psychosocial biological age from validated scales. I plan to train an elastic-net model to predict mortality and functional decline, convert predicted risk to an age-equivalent, and compute psychosocial aging acceleration. I also plan to test whether caregiving exposure is associated with accelerated psychosocial aging.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Lu Tian, “A review of Family Caregiving and Biological Aging.”</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">I’m writing a scoping review to understand how caregiving might affect biological aging, and I’ve focused on three broad and meaningful measures rather than a single biomarker like telomere length. The first is DNA methylation clocks—tools like PhenoAge and GrimAge that estimate biological age by looking at DNA patterns, and they’ve been shown to predict health outcomes better than earlier biomarkers. The second, intrinsic capacity, captures the combined physical and mental abilities a person can draw on at any moment—including mobility, thinking skills, sensory functions, vitality, and mood. And the third measure, frailty, reflects how susceptible someone becomes as their reserves shrink—a practical indicator of vulnerability in older adults. I chose these three because they’re better linked with health outcomes and lend themselves more readily to clinical action in geriatric care than narrow biomarkers like telomere length.</span></p>
